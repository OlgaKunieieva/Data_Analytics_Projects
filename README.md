# Data_Analytics_Projects
1. Grocery_store_analysys
- Description:
In this project, we will dive into the world of selling products in different regions of a single shop chain. Using Python libraries and data science principles, we will discover valuable insights into customer behaviour, product characteristics and sales trends. This research will help us understand market dynamics and possibly help us make strategic business decisions.

- Technologies: 
Python (Data analysis and visualization) Libraries: Pandas (Data manipulation), NumPy (Numerical computing), Matplotlib/Seaborn (Data visualization)

2. Profit Dashboard - This is an example of a dashboard on the data we analysed in the Grocery_store_analysys project. Here in the dashboard we can easily trace the dynamics of income by region, by year and by individual product groups.
